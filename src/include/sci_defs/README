Note:

All of these *testdefs.h.in files are templates that are automatically
turned into the corresponding *defs.h file on the _BINARY_ side of the
tree by the configure script.

You should include only the specific file that you are interested in.
For example, you would use:

#include <sci_defs/tetgen_defs.h>

in any .cc or .h file that uses:

#ifdef HAVE_TETGEN
