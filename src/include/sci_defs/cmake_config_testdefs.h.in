/* The following system variables are updated by configure, via this line:

AC_CONFIG_HEADER(include/sci_defs/config_testdefs.h)

(While we aren't certain exactly how, the AC_CONFIG_HEADER macro will
parse the config_testdefs.h.in file [this file] and replace the
'#define VARIABLE value' with the correct value by testing to see if
the associated include header file exists/compiles on your system.
This apparently only works for certain system defined variables.)

If you are looking at this file on the src side (ie, it is named
'config_testdefs.h.in'), you will see these variables set to '0'.  But
if you are looking at the already configured file (config_defs.h on
the binary side), they will have the correct '0' or '1' value.
