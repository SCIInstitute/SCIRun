///@brief With this module the user is able to position tDCS electrodes and TMS coils to setup a simulation scenario.
///

///@author
/// Moritz Dannhauer
///
///@details
/// The module gets the triangulated scalp surface as the first input and a matrix of possible locations as the second. The third and any following input fields (dynamic input ports)
/// are considered to be prototypes of electrodes or TMS coils that need to be positioned. After the first execution using a minimum of 3 (valid) inputs the positions appear as table rows
/// in the GUI. The GUI allows to assign a prototype (first table column), normal direction etc. as well as the type of stimulation (second table column). Based on the choices made in the
/// first (prototype, "Input #") and second column (stimulation type, "Type") information are gathered from the rest of the row. An defined tDCS electrode or TMS coil will be moved using
/// its location ("X","Y","Z"), its normal ("NX","NY","NZ") and can be rotated along its normal by the angle table cell defined in degrees. Throughout this table, multiple electrodes and TMS coils
/// can be located at their final destinations. For a tDCS electrode specification, the placed and oriented prototype (contains electrode dimension) is used to cut the scalp that is covered by the
/// electrode. This piece of scalp and its normals are used to generate the electrode sponge shape by using the thickness table parameter. The module contains three outputs: 1) the averaged scalp
/// sponge locations (+thickness, as a DenseMatrix) which are designed to be the last input of the SetupTDCS module, 2) a collection of all valid tDCS electrodes and 3) a collection of all
/// valid TMS coil inputs that are represented by rotated points and dipole normals approximating the magnetic field.
