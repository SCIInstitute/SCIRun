///@details
/// This module computes the minimal norm, least squared solution to a
///  nx3 linear system.
/// Given four input ColumnMatrices (v0,v1,v2,b),
///  find the three coefficients (w0,w1,w2) that minimize:
///  | (w0v0 + w1v1 + w2v2) - b |.
/// If more than one minimum exists (the system is under-determined),
///  choose the coefficients such that (w0,w1,w2) has minimum norm.
/// We output the vector (w0,w1,w2) as a row-matrix,
///  and we output the ColumnMatrix (called x), which is: | w0v0 + w1v1 + w2v2 |.
