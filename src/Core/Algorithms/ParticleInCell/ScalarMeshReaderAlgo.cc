   email from Franz Poschel, dated 16 June 2022: PIConGPU Issue 4162; https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/issues/4162


To Do:
    Implement a process for particle sample rate, mesh (node) sample rate, and mesh slice through a specified x, y, or z axis point
    Implement all of the above as config settings
    Figure out why including PSypy in the output (TBG Plugins option in the .cfg file) causes an execution crash

The current known to be functional implementation is the LaserWakefield simulation using any of the following config files 1.cfg, 2.cfg and sst.cfg
I have successfully tested the following PIConGPU module UI entries for Simulation and Config file:
    $PIC_EXAMPLES/LaserWakefield
    $PIC_CFG/sst.cfg
    $PIC_CFG/1.cfg
