///@brief This module computes the magnetic vector potential for a given mesh.

///
///@details
///  The modules has four inputs: an electric field distribution (first) for mesh elements with defnied conductivity tensors (second), dipole sources (third)
///  within that mesh and detector locations (fourth) to compute the magnetic field at. All inputs are of Field datatype. The algorithm/module is multi-threaded and
///  outputs the magnetic vector potential and its magnitudes as first and second output.
