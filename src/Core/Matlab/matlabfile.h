/*
* CLASS DESCRIPTION
* This class is an interface to a matfile and handles the importing and exporting
* matlabarray objects. The latter represent the full complexity of a Matlab array.
*
* MEMORY MODEL
* The class maintains its own copies of the data. Each vector, string and other
* data unit is copied.
* Large quantities of data are shipped in and out as matlabarray objects. These
* objects are handles to complex structures in memory and maintain their own data integrity.
* When copying a matfiledata object only pointers are copied, however all information
* for freeing the object is stored inside and no memory losses should occur.
*
* ERROR HANDLING
* All errors are reported as exceptions described in the matfilebase class.
* Errors of external c library functions are caught and forwarded as exceptions.
*
* COPYING/ASSIGNMENT
* Do not copy the object, this will lead to errors (NEED TO FIX THIS)
*
* RESOURCE ALLOCATION
* Files are closed by calling close() or by destroying the object
*
