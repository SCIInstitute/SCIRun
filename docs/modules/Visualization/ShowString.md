# ShowString

This module puts the contents of a string in the viewer window.

**Detailed Description**

This module is able to display multiple lines of information into the viewer window. The module takes a string as input and displays the contents on top of the viewer window. If there are 'newlines' in the string multiple lines are displayed (up to ten lines). In the GUI the font size and color can be altered as well as the location of where to plot the text. This module is intended to provide the user with a means to put any arbitrary information about the data being shown inside the figure.
