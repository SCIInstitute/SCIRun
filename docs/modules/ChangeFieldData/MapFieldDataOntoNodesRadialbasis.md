# MapFieldDataOntoNodesRadialbasis

Maps data centered on the nodes to another set of nodes using a radial basis.

**Detailed Description**

The first input field is the source field and the second input is the target field. The fields should be formatted for the data to be set on the nodes.

The gui options allow you to set a maximum distance over which to the data will be interpolated. Everything outside that range will be set to the default outside value.
