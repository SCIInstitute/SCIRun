### SCIRun 5.0

[SCIRun](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/SCIRun) is a problem solving environment developed by the NIH Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing at the University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute.

SCIRun 5 is a complete rewrite of the GUI front end and graphical components of SCIRun 4, including a more stable and efficient middle layer, with support for Python scripting.

*Warning! SCIRun 5 is beta software, you may use for real science but beware of instability.*
